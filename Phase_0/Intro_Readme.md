OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library.
It’s a huge collection of tools and functions built to make working with images, videos, and real-time computer vision applications easier.

Think of it as the Swiss Army Knife for:
Image processing
Object detection
Face recognition
Augmented reality
Machine learning tasks involving vision

It’s written mainly in C++, but has bindings for Python, Java, and more — so you don’t have to be a C++ wizard to use it.



"Who developed OpenCV?"
Intel originally developed OpenCV in 1999.
